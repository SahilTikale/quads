    Sets http_client to an object which makes HTTP requests with
    authentication. It chooses an authentication backend as follows:

    1. If the variables 'allocator_url', 'allocator_username', and 
       'allocator_password' are defined in the `quads.yml`,
       it will use HTTP basic auth, with the corresponding
       user name and password.
    2. If the `python-keystoneclient` library is installed, and then 
        make sure following keys are defined in `quads.yml` with appropriate
        values:

           * OS_AUTH_URL
           * OS_USERNAME
           * OS_PASSWORD
           * OS_PROJECT_NAME

       If these keys are available then Keystone will be used 
       to initialize the HIL library.
